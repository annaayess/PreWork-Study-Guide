## Usage

This Study Guide can be used to look back on the material that was discussed in the Prework Modules.
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
Included in this Study Guide are HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. HTML was used as the foundation for what is seen on the website. In this file you can see what language the HTML doc is in, different topics, and even a cute image was included! With the CSS file we styled the HTML page. I added the sections to be different colors, boxed off and just "beautified" the page to look a bit nicer. Finally with DevTools installed- if you right click in the HTML page and press Inspect, then Console, you can see that JavaScript was added to the page to make it more interactive.

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
